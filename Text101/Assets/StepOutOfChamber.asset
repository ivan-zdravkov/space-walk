  storyText: "You push yourself out of the pod, but your legs don't yet work the way
    you want them to. You try to wobble your way out, and had there been gravity,
    you would have surely fell to the ground. Instead, you shoot yourself against
    the white panels of the ceiling. Your arms are also not very responsive and you
    fail to raise them as your face meets the polymer. As you turn weightless a siren
    begins wailing somewhere in the distance. You open your eyes and see the Medical
    Bay coridor light up in red. \n\n1. Steady yourself and examine the situation."
