  m_Name: A7. Die In Hibernation Room
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  storyText: 'You start bashing the glass door of the hibernation chamber. The glass
    cracks a bit, but doesn''t break. You start coughing from the smoke already filling
    the room. The emergency procedures of the Medical Bay and Hibernation Bay failed
    to act, but as the fire aproaches the Storage Coridor, the gate closes, and the
    air vents into space. The fire stops immediately, but filling the rooms with air
    again takes more time than what your tired body can last without oxygen. You black
    out. Death comes almost pleasantly.


    THE END.


    1.  Try again.'
