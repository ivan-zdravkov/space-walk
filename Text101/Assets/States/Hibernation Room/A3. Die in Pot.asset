  storyText: 'You rest for a bit more. You zone out the blaring alarm and try to meditate
    yourself into getting up. Soon you are alone with your breath and thoughts. No
    visuals, no sounds, only... serenity. Your breathing comes to a halt as you join
    Nirvana. You do not know if it was the hibernation sickness or your advanced focusing
    training that didn''t alert you to the smoke entering the room and the rising
    CO2 levels caused by the fire in the Medical Bay. Your last quiet thougts flicker
    and then extinguish as your body is engulfed in flames.


    THE END.


    1. Try again.'
