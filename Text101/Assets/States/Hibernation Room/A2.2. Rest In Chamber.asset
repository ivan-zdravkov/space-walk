  storyText: 'You need a moment to gather yourself. You close your eyes and clear
    your mind. You feel the tips of your fingers, the hairs of your neck, the calming
    pulse of the fluorescent lighting. As the pain settles and your body begins to
    recalibrate itself, a loud siren wails in the distant coridors. You hear the sound
    coming from the left. The medical bay. You were there just 10 minutes ago for
    the final checkups. 10 minutes relative time atleast. You must now be 2.5 light
    years away from the Earth you knew and the people you outlived by 10 generations.


    1. Force yourself out of the pod

    2. Stay in the pod. Someone will take care of it, and you need a bit more time
    to rest'
