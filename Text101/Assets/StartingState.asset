  storyText: "The chamber creeks and the glass panel slides open. Your neck is stiff
    and all your joints ache. You are out of breath and you can clearly feel the atrophy
    of your muscles. They have trained you for this back in the academy, but given
    that hibernations shortens your life span, this is your first time actually going
    under. The ice baths back home really don't do justice to the nausiating feeling
    all the firing neurons in your brain cause.\r\n\r\n1. Step out of the chamber...\r\n2.
    Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths...\r\n"
