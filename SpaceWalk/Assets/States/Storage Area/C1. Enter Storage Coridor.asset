  storyText: "You rush to the storage corridor, just as the safety procedures activate,
    the gate closses and the air of the rooms you were just in vent into space. Your

    you hope. No point dwelling on that now. You should get to the command deck and
    try to figure out what went wrong.\r\n\r\n1. Continue.\r\n"
