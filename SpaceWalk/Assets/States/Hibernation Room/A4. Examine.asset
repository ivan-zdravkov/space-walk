  storyText: "You look around the room and see the other 5 pods of your team members
    undisturbed. No one is up, but you. Their bodies lie in the blue tint of hibernation
    sleep. The medical officer should have been the first to wake, and prepare everyone
    else for safe awakening process. Something is really off. You turn to the Medical
    Bay and hear fire cracking and smoke coming through the gate. You try to seal
    and vent the room, but the controls are not responding. \r\n\r\n1. Go to the Medical
    Bay and try to put out the fire.\r\n2. Try to wake your crew members.\r\n3. Escape
